        <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
        <h2>by robert frost</h2>

<div class="first">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</div>
And sorry I could not travel both
<div class="second">And be one traveler, long I stood</div>
And looked down one as far as I could
<div class="third">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>

Then took the other, as just as fair,
<div class="fourth">And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
<div class="fifth">Though as for that the passing there</div>
Had worn them really about the same,
