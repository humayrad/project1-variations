            <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>

                <div class="first">Two roads <br>diverged<br> in a yellow wood,<br>
                And sorry I could not <br>travel<br> both<br>
                And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                And looked <br>down <br>one as far as I could<br>
                To where it <br>bent <br>in the undergrowth;</div>
                
              <div class="second">  Then <br>took<br>the other, as just as fair,<br>
                And having <br>perhaps<br> the better claim,<br>
                Because it was <br>grassy<br> and wanted wear;<br>
                Though as for that the <br>passing<br> there<br>
                Had worn them<br> really<br> about the same,</div>
